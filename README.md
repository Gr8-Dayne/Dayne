### **Growth Mindset**

To me, this concept was first introduced to me in the Marine Corps Martial Arts program (MCMAP). My instructor would always insist that he was a **Eternal Student** which means that he aspired to never stop learning. Granted, he was talking about hand-to-hand combat but since that day I have been implementing that mindset to most everything that I do. 

In my own words Growth Mindset means: Don't close your brain off to new and potentially better ways to do something because you're used to a traditional approach.

1. Don't pre-occupy yourself with failure
2. Use failures as learning opportunity
3. Don't be afraid to ask questions

>If at first you don't succeed, try try try again.
